## Data Science for fun

* [Analysis of my own Twitter](http://vivianamarquez.com/Twitter1K/): To celebrate having reached 1K followers on Twitter, I analyzed my own account using Data Science.
* [Chsime y Python](http://vivianamarquez.com/ChismeYPython/): What happens when you apply Data Science to your best friend's chat history?
* [Slack Reactions dashboard](https://msds2019.herokuapp.com/): MSDS Cohort #7 was a crazy one and this dashboard about their Slack conversations shows it (give it a few seconds to load, it's running on free Dynos).
* [Travel Dashboard](http://vivianamarquez.com/pages/TravelDashboard/): I am passionate about traveling, so I created my own travel dashboard using Tableau. ([Here for Plotly version](http://vivianamarquez.com/pages/map.html))
