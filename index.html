        <title>✨ About Me</title>
	      
	      I'm a multifaceted professional with a fervor for data science, education, and empowerment. With over 10 years of coding experience, I've navigated through various sectors, leveraging data to drive innovation in advertising, marketing, retail, and cybersecurity.

As an educator, I've had the honor of guiding over 1,300 students across the globe in mastering AI and data skills. My passion for knowledge-sharing stems from a simple yet profound belief: understanding technology in the modern age is as essential as literacy in times gone by.

Outside the tech realm, I've embraced the spotlight as Miss Sucre, making it to the top 13 at Miss Universe Colombia 2021, and I've connected with diverse audiences as a Radio and TV host in multiple countries.

        <title>🚀 Miss Factorial Academy</title>

        As the proud founder of Miss Factorial Academy, I am deeply passionate about transforming AI and data education into an engaging journey. In a world where data fluency has become as indispensable as literacy, my goal is to unlock the power of science and technology for all, transcending profession, socioeconomic status, cultural background, or educational level. Guided by the belief that learning should be as exciting as the most captivating episodes of your favorite series, I steer Miss Factorial Academy towards a future where every lesson is an adventure, every concept a discovery, and every student a story of success waiting to unfold.
