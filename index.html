        <b><big>✨ About Me</big></b>
        <br><br>
	      I'm a <b>Developer Relations Engineer</b> based in San Francisco, working at the intersection of communication, education, and technology. I develop open-source cookbooks, speak at industry conferences, and host virtual and in-person events across SF, NYC, and London.
        <br><br>
        With <b>15+ years of experience</b>, my journey started in 2010 as a tech radio host, continued through university degrees in data science, mathematics, and media production, and included five years as a <b>Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer</b>. Along the way, I've <b>taught AI and data skills to 4,000+ learners</b> across the Americas, Europe, and Africa, working with communities across a wide range of educational and sociocultural contexts. I have also led public science outreach events and delivered talks/posters at academic conferences.
        <br><br>
        <b>My Teaching Philosophy:</b><br>
        <b>Clarity</b> — misconceptions compound quickly in technical subjects<br>
        <b>Practicality</b> — people need applicable skills tailored to their goals<br>
        <b>Entertainment</b> — learning happens when people are genuinely having fun
        <br><br>
        Outside of my career, I enjoy traveling (31 countries and counting!), learning languages, and understanding how culture shapes the way people think, communicate, and connect.
